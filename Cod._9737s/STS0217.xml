               <note>Had been waiting for his brother Sibrant to return from Hamburg in order to find out which of Jan's possessions were still with him. Had found his prayer booklet and a rosary in his pocket. Had been hit in his temple while standing up and then fell into the river Elbe together with his possessions that he was carrying on him. (They got him from the water and cut off both of his hands??) Was found next morning at Artelenburgh standing up in the water with only his head above the surface. Person who found him thought he was still alive and got him on board of his ship, then brought the body on shore where he was burried. Sibrant had to dig up the body from the graveyard. I think he is then asking Tengnagel for help/assitance - bit about being instruments of God and God's reward of people who do good deeds. Hopes to come to Vienna before Easter? Something about the obligation again. In the attachment Jan van Wijninghen reports on the news, especially on Spinola and the Siega of Breda. Some numbers of troops (around Rotterdam?), something about calling reenforcements from England.</note>
