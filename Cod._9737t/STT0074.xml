               <note>LOT: 
Seeks Tengnagel's help in a (business?) matter that she, as a woman, cannot resolve. Is trying to receive money that someone owes her? Asks Tengnagel for advice as for what to do. Has a young man living with her and taking care of some of her business - he used to do the bookkeeping for her late-husband. Would send him to get the money if she knew this would be futile, but is not sure if it's worth the costs of the journey. Has received a letter from 'Pater Lambertij' saying that he needs to travel to Rome and that he will transfer help is her business to someone else. Also writes that he would personally go to Vienna to talk to the Emperor on her behalf. Asks Tengnagel if this has indeed happened. Also asks if he knows who Pater Lambertij has assigned to help her, and where he lives and if he is Dutch. Also what answer Pater Lambertij received from the Emperor. Her and her five children will be forever greatful for Tengnagel's help and his charity towards 'us widows'. Kids will grow up knowing what Tengnagel did for his parents, and then for his mother (so it looks like there was a longer relationship), and will be told to repay these favours if they ever have the means to. Ends by writing she would have written to Pater Lambertij, but she does not know where to reach him.</note>
